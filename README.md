# data_models
HTML data models for normalizing datastreams in Adverity

To make changes to a model, navigate to [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), import the .html file, and make edits there. You should be able to change the model, save as the same file name in the repo, then push any changes made.
